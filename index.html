        <h2>Who is Eldaniz Babayev? The Basics üöÄ</h2>
        <p>Eldaniz Babayev is a young robotics genius tearing it up in the world of perception and motion planning. He‚Äôs based in Pozna≈Ñ, Poland, but his vibes scream global innovator. Specializing in 3D scene understanding, 3D mapping, and motion planning for autonomous robots, he‚Äôs basically teaching robots to see and move like pros. At PUT Mobile Robots Lab, he‚Äôs cooking up next-level 3D environment scene understanding techniques and slick motion planning pipelines using cutting-edge 3D mapping tech.</p>
        <p>Twitter (X) handle: <a href="https://x.com/s4movar">@s4movar</a> with a bio that slaps: ‚ÄúRobotics & Software | CEO @ Neuronav.io | I make robots see and move‚Äù His profile pic? A cool shot of him looking ready to conquer the robotics world.</p>
        <p>From his X activity, Eldaniz is all about pushing boundaries. He‚Äôs a researcher at Pozna≈Ñ University of Technology (PUT) IRIM, and the founder of <a href="https://www.neuronav.io/">Neuronav.io</a>, where he‚Äôs building SLAM as a Service (more on that later, it‚Äôs wild!).  He always flexing his software engineering chops. His posts show he‚Äôs deep into robotics conferences, coding in Rust, and even vibing with some tech banter.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Interests:</strong> AI, Robotics, Computer Vision, Robotic Perception, and probably making robots do cool tricks.</li>
            <li><strong>Skills:</strong> Proficient in Python, Rust, C++, ROS (Robot Operating System), IsaacSim, CUDA, and likely a few more tech wizardries.</li>
            <li><strong>Vibes:</strong> Posts about conferences (like PP-RAI 2025), coding struggles, and robotics breakthroughs. Also, he‚Äôs got a playful side‚Äîcheck his replies for some meme-worthy tech humor!</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Neuronav.io: SLAM as a Service Done Right! ü§ñüó∫Ô∏èüòÇ</h2>
        <p>Hold onto your circuits, because this is where Eldaniz Babayev is SLAM-ming it out of the park! He's the CEO of <strong>Neuronav.io</strong>, a cutting-edge company delivering <em>SLAM as a Service</em> (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping, for those who thought it was about epic door slams). This is all about making robots and autonomous systems navigate like pros without breaking the bank. Let‚Äôs dive into the juicy details of this robotics revolution!</p>
        
        <p><strong>Company Description:</strong> Neuronav.io is a tech startup focused on providing cloud-based SLAM solutions for robotics, autonomous vehicles, and smart infrastructure. Their mission? To make advanced 3D mapping and navigation accessible to everyone, from robot hobbyists to massive logistics companies. They specialize in real-time localization, 3D scene understanding, and motion planning, leveraging AI, computer vision, and machine learning to power autonomous systems. Think of it as a super-smart robot brain for navigating complex environments like warehouses, factories, or even your local mall!</p>
        
        <p><strong>What‚Äôs SLAM as a Service?</strong> Neuronav.io takes the heavy lifting out of SLAM. Instead of companies building their own expensive, compute-heavy SLAM systems, Neuronav offers a scalable, cloud-based platform. Their tech integrates with existing hardware (cameras, LiDAR, sensors) to deliver real-time mapping and navigation data. It‚Äôs like renting a genius-level navigation system that can map a space, dodge obstacles, and plan paths, all without you needing a PhD in robotics. Eldaniz‚Äôs expertise in 3D mapping and perception is the secret sauce here, making environments understandable for machines in real time.</p>
                
        <p><strong>Website:</strong> <a href="https://www.neuronav.io/">neuronav.io</a> ‚Äì Check it out for the latest on their SLAM-tastic tech! (Note: If the site‚Äôs sparse, it‚Äôs because they‚Äôre too busy building robot brains to update the CSS. Classic startup life.)</p>
                
        <p><strong>SLAM Connection:</strong> Eldaniz‚Äôs work at Pozna≈Ñ University of Technology‚Äôs Mobile Robots Lab feeds directly into Neuronav.io. His research on 3D scene understanding and motion planning (think robots figuring out where they are and where to go without crashing) is the backbone of their tech. They‚Äôre likely using advanced algorithms like NeRF (Neural Radiance Fields) or 3D Gaussian Splatting for super-precise mapping. Imagine a robot navigating a chaotic warehouse with boxes everywhere ‚Äì Neuronav‚Äôs SLAM makes it glide through like it‚Äôs on a Sunday stroll.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Why It‚Äôs Cool:</strong> Neuronav.io is democratizing robotics navigation. Small startups can now afford enterprise-grade SLAM without building it from scratch. Plus, Eldaniz‚Äôs skills in Python, Rust, C++, ROS, and CUDA mean their tech is fast, efficient, and ready for the future.</p>
