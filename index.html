        <h2>Who is Eldaniz Babayev? The Basics 🚀</h2>
        <p>Eldaniz Babayev is a young robotics genius tearing it up in the world of perception and motion planning. He’s based in Poznań, Poland, but his vibes scream global innovator. Specializing in 3D scene understanding, 3D mapping, and motion planning for autonomous robots, he’s basically teaching robots to see and move like pros. At PUT Mobile Robots Lab, he’s cooking up next-level 3D environment scene understanding techniques and slick motion planning pipelines using cutting-edge 3D mapping tech.</p>
        <p>Twitter (X) handle: <a href="https://x.com/s4movar">@s4movar</a> with a bio that slaps: “Robotics & Software | CEO @ Neuronav.io | I make robots see and move” His profile pic? A cool shot of him looking ready to conquer the robotics world.</p>
        <p>From his X activity, Eldaniz is all about pushing boundaries. He’s a researcher at Poznań University of Technology (PUT) IRIM, and the founder of <a href="https://www.neuronav.io/">Neuronav.io</a>, where he’s building SLAM as a Service (more on that later, it’s wild!).  He always flexing his software engineering chops. His posts show he’s deep into robotics conferences, coding in Rust, and even vibing with some tech banter.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Interests:</strong> AI, Robotics, Computer Vision, Robotic Perception, and probably making robots do cool tricks.</li>
            <li><strong>Skills:</strong> Proficient in Python, Rust, C++, ROS (Robot Operating System), IsaacSim, CUDA, and likely a few more tech wizardries.</li>
            <li><strong>Vibes:</strong> Posts about conferences (like PP-RAI 2025), coding struggles, and robotics breakthroughs. Also, he’s got a playful side—check his replies for some meme-worthy tech humor!</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Neuronav.io: SLAM as a Service Done Right! 🤖🗺️😂</h2>
        <p>Hold onto your circuits, because this is where Eldaniz Babayev is SLAM-ming it out of the park! He's the CEO of <strong>Neuronav.io</strong>, a cutting-edge company delivering <em>SLAM as a Service</em> (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping, for those who thought it was about epic door slams). This is all about making robots and autonomous systems navigate like pros without breaking the bank. Let’s dive into the juicy details of this robotics revolution!</p>
        
        <p><strong>Company Description:</strong> Neuronav.io is a tech startup focused on providing cloud-based SLAM solutions for robotics, autonomous vehicles, and smart infrastructure. Their mission? To make advanced 3D mapping and navigation accessible to everyone, from robot hobbyists to massive logistics companies. They specialize in real-time localization, 3D scene understanding, and motion planning, leveraging AI, computer vision, and machine learning to power autonomous systems. Think of it as a super-smart robot brain for navigating complex environments like warehouses, factories, or even your local mall!</p>
        
        <p><strong>What’s SLAM as a Service?</strong> Neuronav.io takes the heavy lifting out of SLAM. Instead of companies building their own expensive, compute-heavy SLAM systems, Neuronav offers a scalable, cloud-based platform. Their tech integrates with existing hardware (cameras, LiDAR, sensors) to deliver real-time mapping and navigation data. It’s like renting a genius-level navigation system that can map a space, dodge obstacles, and plan paths, all without you needing a PhD in robotics. Eldaniz’s expertise in 3D mapping and perception is the secret sauce here, making environments understandable for machines in real time.</p>
                
        <p><strong>Website:</strong> <a href="https://www.neuronav.io/">neuronav.io</a> – Check it out for the latest on their SLAM-tastic tech! (Note: If the site’s sparse, it’s because they’re too busy building robot brains to update the CSS. Classic startup life.)</p>
                
        <p><strong>SLAM Connection:</strong> Eldaniz’s work at Poznań University of Technology’s Mobile Robots Lab feeds directly into Neuronav.io. His research on 3D scene understanding and motion planning (think robots figuring out where they are and where to go without crashing) is the backbone of their tech. They’re likely using advanced algorithms like NeRF (Neural Radiance Fields) or 3D Gaussian Splatting for super-precise mapping. Imagine a robot navigating a chaotic warehouse with boxes everywhere – Neuronav’s SLAM makes it glide through like it’s on a Sunday stroll.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Why It’s Cool:</strong> Neuronav.io is democratizing robotics navigation. Small startups can now afford enterprise-grade SLAM without building it from scratch. Plus, Eldaniz’s skills in Python, Rust, C++, ROS, and CUDA mean their tech is fast, efficient, and ready for the future.</p>
